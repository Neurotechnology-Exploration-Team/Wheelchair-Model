### Factors:
- Number of Channels (C): Suppose your EEG headset has 8 channels.
- Sampling Rate (R): For example, 250 Hz.
- Window Size (W): The duration of each segment, say 1 second.
- Overlap Percentage (O): Commonly 50%, but can vary based on your needs.
- Calculations:
- Samples Per Window: Given a sampling rate of 250 Hz and a window size of 1 second, each window will contain 250 samples. So, for 8 channels, that's 250 samples/channel * 8 channels = 2000 samples per window.

- Number of Windows: This depends on the total duration of your recording and the overlap. For a 50% overlap, each window starts halfway through the previous window. If your total recording is T seconds long, the number of windows will be approximately (2 * T) / W (since each second is effectively covered twice).

### Data Shape:
- Without Considering Overlap: Each window will have a shape of (C, R * W) â†’ (8, 250 * 1) = (8, 250).
- With Overlap: The total shape of the data will depend on the number of windows. If you have N windows, the shape will be (N, C, R * W).
### Example:
- If you have a 60-second EEG recording with 1-second windows and 50% overlap, you'll have approximately 120 windows (assuming the first window starts at 0 seconds). Thus, the shape of your preprocessed data would be (120, 8, 250).
- Implementation:
- In Python, you would typically use a loop to segment the data. Each iteration would extract a window of data from the EEG recording, considering the overlap, and store it in an array.

### Considerations:
The first and last windows may not align perfectly with the start and end of the recording, especially with overlapping.
Ensure that your windowing process aligns with the labels appropriately, especially if the labels are time-specific (like marking events at certain times).
